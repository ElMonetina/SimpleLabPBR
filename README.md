SimpleLabPBR is a very minimal resource pack for Minecraft Java Edition. It provides textures for shaders to apply a number of effects following the LabPBR Material Standard

The RP is in a very early stage and i will be able to work on it only in my free time, therefore progression speed may vary.

SimpleLabPBR started as a personal project, but I quickly decided to maki it public and free, which it will always remain.
